# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is a smart purchasing assistant that automates buying processes through countdown detection and automated clicking. The current implementation is a monolithic single-file application that needs restructuring for better maintainability, testability, and extensibility. The restructuring will transform the existing functionality into a well-organized, modular architecture while preserving all current features and improving code quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this codebase, I want the application to be organized into logical modules, so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend different components without affecting unrelated functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is restructured THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into distinct modules (core logic, GUI, configuration, OCR processing, automation)
2. WHEN modules are created THEN each module SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
3. WHEN the restructuring is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality without regression
4. WHEN new features are added THEN developers SHALL be able to modify individual modules without affecting others

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the application, so that I can easily debug issues and monitor system behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in any module THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context
2. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL provide structured logging with appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
3. WHEN exceptions are raised THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN debugging is needed THEN logs SHALL contain sufficient information to trace execution flow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer extending this application, I want a clean configuration management system, so that I can easily add new configuration options and maintain backward compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is managed THEN the system SHALL use a dedicated configuration module with validation
2. WHEN new configuration options are added THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing config files
3. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation error messages
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support runtime configuration updates where appropriate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this codebase, I want comprehensive unit tests for all components, so that I can confidently make changes without introducing regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are written THEN each module SHALL have corresponding unit tests with good coverage
2. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL validate both success and failure scenarios
3. WHEN code changes are made THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass or be updated appropriately
4. WHEN new functionality is added THEN corresponding tests SHALL be written

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of this application, I want all existing functionality to work exactly as before, so that the restructuring doesn't break my current workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the restructured application runs THEN all GUI functionality SHALL work identically to the original
2. WHEN the restructured application runs THEN all CLI functionality SHALL work identically to the original
3. WHEN configuration files are used THEN they SHALL remain compatible with the existing format
4. WHEN the application is executed THEN performance SHALL be equivalent or better than the original

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working on this project, I want clear documentation and type hints throughout the codebase, so that I can understand the code structure and API contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN all functions and classes SHALL have comprehensive docstrings
2. WHEN functions are defined THEN they SHALL include type hints for parameters and return values
3. WHEN modules are created THEN they SHALL include module-level documentation explaining their purpose
4. WHEN the project is documented THEN it SHALL include updated README with the new structure

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer deploying this application, I want proper dependency management and project structure, so that I can easily set up development environments and manage dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is structured THEN it SHALL follow Python packaging best practices
2. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN they SHALL be properly specified with version constraints
3. WHEN the project is set up THEN it SHALL include proper entry points for both GUI and CLI modes
4. WHEN development tools are configured THEN they SHALL include linting, formatting, and testing configurations
